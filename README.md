### Comments:
For this week's project our goal was to create a scheduler that included the current date and time and as a resource to accomplish that I used Moments.js, my schedule includes eight timeblocks that represent eight hours of a typical work day starting from 9-6. The schedule also needed to be saved in a local storage so that everytime the schedule is refreshed the events persist on the page.
